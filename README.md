# Django E-commerce App ðŸ›’

Welcome to the Django E-commerce App repository! This project is an E-commerce API built using the Django REST Framework (DRF). It provides a robust backend solution for managing online stores, supporting user authentication through Google OAuth and JWT. You can explore endpoints for managing products, categories, orders, and user profiles. The API documentation is generated using DRF Spectacular, making it easy to understand and use.

## Installation

To get started with the Django E-commerce App, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JobValdez/django-ecommerce-app.git
   cd django-ecommerce-app
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Requirements**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your environment variables, such as database credentials and secret keys.

5. **Run Migrations**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

6. **Start the Development Server**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

Your API should now be running at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

## Usage

Once your server is up and running, you can interact with the API using tools like Postman or curl. Below are some examples of how to use the endpoints.

### Authentication

To authenticate users, you can use the Google OAuth flow or JWT tokens. After logging in, you will receive a token that you can use for subsequent requests.

### Managing Products

- **Create a Product**:
  ```http
  POST /api/products/
  Content-Type: application/json

  {
      "name": "Product Name",
      "price": 29.99,
      "category": "Category ID",
      "description": "Product Description"
  }
  ```

- **Get All Products**:
  ```http
  GET /api/products/
  ```

### Managing Orders

- **Create an Order**:
  ```http
  POST /api/orders/
  Content-Type: application/json

  {
      "user": "User ID",
      "products": [
          {
              "product": "Product ID",
              "quantity": 2
          }
      ]
  }
  ```

- **Get All Orders**:
  ```http
  GET /api/orders/
  ```
